        Version control software, like Git, allows for collaboration between developers and provides a safeguard against
        introducing bugs into projects by storing previously working versions of the project that can be reverted to should
        something go wrong. This is acheived through branching, or making different versions that branch off of the working copy or master. The newer versions with added features, bug fixes, additions/deletions, etc., are only merged into the master copy if approved by someone on the team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to successful version control is keeping the master copy clean and bug-free. The master copy is the main 
        branch where all approved branches (versions) are merged into. A collaborator begings by first making a copy of this 
        master branch to store locally on their machines. Once they have made their changes locally, they push their request
        that it be reviewed and, if approved, merged into the master branch. 
    </p>

        This brings us to Git and GitHub. It's important to know that Git is software, and can be used for many projects
        other than code (spreadsheets, text documents, photos) with or without collabors. But if you are collaborating on a 
        project via Git you'll need a place where your project(s) can be stored and accessed by your different team members.
        GitHub is once such place. 
    </p>
        Here's a quick and dirty overview of the workflow process using Git and GitHub:
        <ol>
          <li>Find the <strong>Repository</strong> (project) you'll be working on on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Make an initial <strong>branch</strong> (copy) of this repo within GitHub using <strong>Fork</strong>
          <li>Now that you have the branch created online, you'll want to store it locally on your compter by using <strong>clone</strong></li>
          <li>Copy the URL of your forked repository</li>
          <li>Fire up your terminal and paste this url after typing in the git command <strong>git clone</strong></li>
          <li></li>
