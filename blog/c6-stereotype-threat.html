  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

    The research on stereotype threat and how powerful the act of reframing 
    the context of a potentially threatening situation can be in attenuating 
    the threat is fascinating to me. I definitely remember hearing (and sadly 
    believing) "girls are bad at naturally bad at math." I also remember being exposed to many other "positive" stereotypes about women that were 
    probably meant to temper the bad ones: "women are better at multi-
    tasking, girls are more verbal than boys at a younger age," etc. 
    Unfortunately they just served to reinforce the idea that I was 
    biologically incapable of being good at math, and that I am a "language-
    person."

    Upon acceptance into DBC you are given a list of optional reading. One of 
    the books on the list was <em>A Mind For Numbers</em> by Barbara 
    Oakley. It's written for people exactly like me who suffered under the 
    illusion that they just aren't wired for math and science and gives 
    insight how to the inevitable confusion that comes with these subjects is 
    just part of the learning process and not a reason to give up. 
    I actually started to become angry reading it thinking about all 
    missed opportunities I had growing up to learn about subjects that I 
    found fascinating, but never even attempted because of the math involved. 
    I also had a list of teachers that really dropped the ball in terms of 
    understanding and motivating fellow "mathphobes." Instead, whether 
    explicit or not, the stereotype that girls just aren't good at math 
    was reinforced.

    The extremely good news about the stereotype threat research is how little
    it takes to actually undermine and diffuse the perceived stereotype 
    threats. Something as simple as taking the time before a test to 
    let students know that gender or race won't play a part in their
    ability to do well on the test, or to place questions about race or 
    gender at  the end of the test rather than at the beginning is 
    surprisingly effective in leveling performance across racial and gender
    lines. I hope this research becomes more well known and integrated into
    our educational system.
