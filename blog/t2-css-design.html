    The concept of classes and IDs in CSS is a bit confusing because they do exactly the same thing, so their use can seem
    interchangeable. To make matters more confusing you will often see classes and IDs used together on the same element. I'm going to try to
    explain their appropriate uses here.

    <p>
    Classes can (and should) be created once and used over and over for a number of different elements that share the same styling. IDs on the other hand
    are to be used for unique elements (a sidebar is a great example because most websites only have one) that will not share
	specific stying with any other elements on the page. Additionally, each page is limited to one element with a specific ID. (If you use more than one, it will be caught in a validator.)

    Chris Coyer uses a great analogy in this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/">article</a> classes are like bar codes and IDs are like serial numbers. If you need to make a broad sweeping change to the style of a page, you can do so by updating the class, much like updating a price in a bar code will change all of the products with that bar code. Whereas a change to an ID, will affect a specific, unique element
    on your page only.
