  <h1>Ruby's group_by Enumerable Method</h1>
  <!--<h2>The subtitle, if you want it</h2>-->
  <h4>08/22/2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Ruby's group_by method transforms an array into a hash with key, value pairs
    that are dictated by a code block of your choosing. It's an extremely useful method 
    best shown by example.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Take an example of an array of names. Let's say you wanted to create plaques for each
    name and you were charged by the letter. But, if you can group names of the same size
    together, you will get a discount since the plaque maker can crank out a bunch of plaques
    using the same setting (economies of scale and all.)
   </p>
    <p>
    Following is an array of names and the group_by method called on it:
    <pre><code>
    names = %w{ Montes Lyons Williams Smith Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele Tchaikovsky Hu Jones 
    Ng Bach }

    names.group_by { |name| name.size }
    </code></pre>

    returns the following hash:
    <pre><code> 
    {6=>["Montes"], 5=>["Lyons", "Smith", "Jones"], 8=>["Williams"], 35=>["Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele"], 
    11=>["Tchaikovsky"], 2=>["Hu", "Ng"], 4=>["Bach"]}
    </code></pre>   
    </p>
    <p>
    Ruby returns a hash with a key for each of the various name lengths. While the keys are unique (all hash keys are) many of the values
    (the names) share a key since they are the same length. With the money you save on grouping Lyons, Smith and Jones you might still be able to afford
    the Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele plaque. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course this hash could be further transformed or ordered to be even more useful, and any number of Ruby methods could be used within the code block.
