   It's hard to wrap your head around fundamental differences in the way programming languages are designed. 
   Switching between them can feel a bit like visiting another planet where your basic concepts don't exist
   or are turned completely upside down like Bizzaro World.

    In Ruby, everything is an object. This is a neat and tidy concept. (At least on the surface.) JavaScript
    has objects as well, but variables, values, properties, and functions are the main building blocks.

    <p>
    Let's compare two very similar data structures: Ruby's hash and JavaScript's object literal. These are both 
    extremely similar in that they both contain key, value pairs. Again, everything in Ruby is an object: the name of
    hash, the keys and the values are all objects. In JavaScript, however, the object literal consists of a variable 
    with properties as keys and values attached to the properties. To further complicate things and take us even further 
    away from Rubyland, properties in JavaScript can be functions, making the property a method.
