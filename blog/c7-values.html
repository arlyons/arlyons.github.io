   When I think about my values, I think about my career and the trajectory
   it has taken over the years. Like a lot of people just out of college, I 
   chose jobs based on what I thought would be the safest, or had the most 
   potential for growth, but were ultimately very
   unfulfilling. 
    </p>
    <p>
   The breaking point was when I took a job cold-calling lured by the promise
   of huge sales commissions. I lasted two grueling weeks, surrounded by some
   of the worst, back-stabbing, greedy people I've ever encountered. I quit
   without another job lined up and felt really lost.  
    </p>
    <p>
  On an absolute whim, I walked into the wine shop down the street to see 
  if they were hiring. It seemed like it would be fun to learn about wine 
  and it didn't seem like an environment that would attract sociopaths. I 
  was hired on the spot. The money was awful, it was incredibly fun and I 
  made friends for life. I thrived there. I was promoted to manager after a 
  few months and really enjoyed learning not only about wine, but how a small
  business was run.  
  </p>
  <p>
  I had ideas for changing some of the systems and procedures to make things
  run more efficiently and the company was small enough and the owners were 
  receptive enough that my ideas were appreciated and implemented.
  </p>

  <p>
  For the first time in my career I felt really competent and proud of my 
  work. I fit in with the culture and really liked my coworkers. This was a
  real lesson for me that if you are guided by your values, things can really
  fall into place.
