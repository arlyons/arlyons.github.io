    I definitely see myself as having a Concrete/Random Gregorc mind style. I'm extremely direct, (diplomacy is something I could work on).
    I also like to work in a less linear fashion, skipping over steps I think might not be necessary or coming back to them later. Because of 
    this, I like to work alone, and have found the pairing sessions, while fun and extremely useful at times, to be a bit tedious and seem like 
    something that is cutting into (scarce) time that I could be devoting to studying on my own.

    I can be overly thorough in my approach to studying at times. Time boxing has been extremely useful in this regard. It's also beneficial
    to have structured breaks, not only for basic mental hygiene, but also to allow for diffuse thinking to take over. I also find that my 
    abstract thinking style really benefits from mind-mapping, especially before and after studying as a way to take stock of what I do and don't
    know about the subject matter and as review. Jotting down ideas in a non-linear fashion and mapping how they are inter-related is perfect for an 
    abstract/non-linear thinking style. It's a great way to use recall and also to see what you were fooled into thinking you learned when in actuality, 
    you're unable to recall it.

    In terms of broadening my horizons for learning techniques, I would really like to discover a way to be better at math. Since I've always hated
    math and believed I was a "language-person", not a "math-person" I missed out on a lot of basic concepts and would really like to revisit
    some of the material I struggled with and hated in school. I know part of the learning process is to be comfortable with the feeling of confusion
    and not to interpret it as a sign of failure, but I feel like there might be a way to learn math that is more suited to my thinking style that would really click for me.
