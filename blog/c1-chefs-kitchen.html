  <h1>DBC Approach To Learning</h1>

      One of the benefits of going back to school as a career changer is having a very high level of motivation.
      The idea of approaching your education with a passive, consumer mindset is not something I'd be able to 
      relate to at this point, though college age me probably could. And from what (granted, very little) interacation I've 
      had with my cohort thus far, this doesn't seem to be the case for them either. It's exciting to see people asking 
      questions via Google+ and seeing how quickly, and without a hint of condescension, people provide answers and help to 
      their peers.

      I'm definitely coming to DBC with a mix of excitement and nervousness. Knowing there is so much to learn, and the sheer 
      amount of work involved is intimidating. Having almost no coding experience, I also worry about how I'll compare to my 
      peers. Shereef's analogy of not worrying if someone is a few hundred steps ahead when you are all walking from San Franciso to Seattle together put things in perspective.

      I was definitely drawn to DBC due to emphasis on teaching empathy, mindfulness and giving and receiving actionable 
      feedback in addition to web development. The 3 intro videos on Engineering Empathy, though short, were really eye 
      opening for me and I'm looking forward to learning more.
