    DBC places a strong emphasis on the value of pairing and constant giving and receiving of feedback. 
    I still get a bit nervous before each pairing session. There is always a fear that that I will be 
    at a much lower knowledge level than my pair and I will hold them back or frustrate them. 
    I'm always pleasantly surprised at how patient and kind all of my pairs have been, and I'm also a bit
    surprised when I am the one who is more knowledgeable and helpful regarding a particular topic in the
    challenge. 
    </p>

    Continually admitting your ignorance and articulating when you are stuck is humbling and can be very
    stressful, but I'm starting to get used to it. I don't really have a problem receiving feedback. I have 
    a pretty thick skin and actually really welcome it. I prefer feedback that is very direct and to the 
    point. Unfortunately, I think if anything I may be too direct at times and give feedback that could be 
    considered unkind. Diplomacy is an area I need to work on.  
    </p>
    In terms of implementing feedback, I know that I have a tendency to be too quiet and not talk through
    my thinking process. This appeared in my feedback a couple of times now. I'm pretty introverted, so 
    while there might be a going on in terms of my thinking process, there is no way for my pair to know 
    this unless I verbalize it. I think checking in with your pair at the beginning of the session and
    asking them to be on the lookout for things like this helps both of you during the session.
