        Version control software, like Git, allows for collaboration between developers and provides a safeguard against introducing bugs into projects by storing previously working versions of the project that can be reverted to should
        something go wrong. This is acheived through branching, or making different versions that branch off of the working copy or master. The newer
        versions with added features, bug fixes, additions/deletions, etc., are only merged into the master copy if approved by someone on the team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to successful version control is keeping the master copy clean and bug-free. The master copy is the main
        branch where all approved branches (versions) are merged into. A collaborator begings by first making a copy of this
        master branch to store locally on their machines. Once they have made their changes locally, they "push" their
        modified version to GitHub for review by their team. Once approved, their version is merged into the master branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        This brings us to Git and GitHub. It's important to know that Git is software, and can be used for many projects
        other than code (spreadsheets, text documents, photos) with or without collaborators. But if you ARE collaborating on a project using Git, you and
        your team will need a place where your project(s) can be stored and accessed by your different team members. GitHub is once such place.
    </p>
        Here's a quick and dirty overview of the workflow process using Git and GitHub:

       <h1>Create a local Repo</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Find the <strong>Repository</strong> (project) you'll be working on on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Make an initial <strong>branch</strong> (copy) of this repo within GitHub using <strong>Fork</strong>
          <li>Now that you have the branch created online, you'll want to store it locally on your compter by using <strong>clone</strong></li>
          <li>Copy the URL of your forked repository</li>
          <li>Fire up your terminal and paste this url after typing in the git command <strong>git clone</strong></li>
          <li>Now you have a local repository to work on.</li>
          </ol>

        <h1>Tracking Changes</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Open terminal and cd to your saved repo.</li>
          <li>Open your text editor and find your repo.</li>
          <li>Make your changes in your text editor and save.</li>
          <li>Back in terminal, type <strong>git status</strong>.</li>
          <li>This will dsplay your changes to be <strong>added</strong>, which is a preliminary step to <strong>commit</strong>. "Adds" appear in green.</
          li>
          <li>Type in <strong>git status</strong>again. You'll see that your change is now yellow. This means it is ready to be committed.</li>
          <li>Important: all "commits" need accompanying comments. To commit your change type <strong>git commit -m "your comment here"</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Pushing and Pull Requests</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a feature-branch by typing: <strong>git checkout -b feature-branch</strong></li>
          <li>Merge the two branches: <strong>git merge master </strong></li>
          <li>Push your changes to GitHub: <strong>git push origin feature-branch</strong>.</li>
          <li>Go to GitHub and click and find the feature-branch you just pushed.</li>
          <li>Click "Pull Request."</li>
          <li>Click "Create Pull Request."</li>
          <li>Click "Merge Pull Request."</li>
          <li>Delete feature-branch.</li>
        </ol>
