                    As a beginner, it's hard to wrap your head around fundamental differences in the way programming languages are designed.
                    Switching between them can feel a bit like visiting another planet where your basic concepts don't exist
                    or are turned completely upside down like Bizzaro World.

                    Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UFti9xL-Jau94TbQcyUUVaWtgYWC891dF-g6kXkVg-0/pubhtml"><u>running tab</u></a> of differences between Ruby and JavaScript that I'll (hopefully) be adding to over the next few months.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Methods in Ruby and JavaScript</h4>
                  <p>
                    One big difference that tripped me up quite a bit when switching from Ruby to JavaScript was the difference in how
                    each handles methods. In Ruby, the terms method and function are interchangeable while in JavaScript a method is more strictly
                    defined as a function <em>created inside an object</em>. Since everything in Ruby is an object, each method that you create, is <em>automatically assigned to the Object class,</em> whereas JavaScript can and does frequently have "free-standing" blocks of code.
                  <p>
                    One of the first things beginning programmers learn is how to work with built-in methods. But it's easy to miss the fact
                    that these methods are really just functions tied to particular objects, and will only work on those specific objects.
                    For example, Ruby's #reverse method is defined within the String class and can only be called on other string objects.
                    JavaScript also has built-in methods which are tied to its global objects (Array, String, Object, etc.) and although there are slight
                    differences in syntax, Ruby and JS share many built-in methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To see the difference, first let's create a Ruby method. Below we have a very bare bones method (a.k.a. function) that takes one argument:</p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/db6f2e61f688bad525813122ac03a69d.js"></script>

                    <p>Outputs: </p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/e947ff9d6fee9da205fff1dd0682a194.js"></script>

                    <p>Here is the same program as a JavaScript function, returning the exact same output: </p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/49eea931456e6dc9c95d7d9c4d709fc3.js"></script>

                    <p>Outputs: </p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/d356ac187635db068952832e3cac4756.js"></script>

                    <p>These two examples are not extremely dissimilar, but once we start working with <strong>Ruby Classes</strong>, both languages start to look more syntactically alike. </p>

                    <p>Here is another very simple Ruby program wherein we create a class and instantiate it: </p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/bfdaa8d273dd84cee4ca2757823638d7.js"></script>

                    <p>Line 13 <code>new_object.greeter</code> is a method call using explicit <strong>dot notation</strong>. Since everything in Ruby is an object, all Ruby method calls are on an object, but sometimes the object is implicit. </p>

                    <p>For example, the Math operators <code>+ - / * </code>are also methods that act on objects. </p>

                    <code>2 + 2 </code> could also be written using <strong>dot notation: </strong>

                    <code>2.+2</code>

                    <p>Another example of a method being called on an implicit object is the <code>puts</code> method. Here the method is being called on whatever object we are currently scoped to. Which in the case of <code>puts</code> is <code>Kernel</code></p>

                    <p>Back to JavaScript. Now that we understand that all Ruby methods are called on objects, <strong>dot notation</strong> in JavaScript is starting to look pretty familiar as well.</p>

                    <p>Recall that in JavaScript, functions <em>are always created inside objects</em>.</p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/11fe76ad48908acc8e7d9bcfa8f591f3.js"></script>

                    <p>
                    Above we've created a JavaScript object, <strong>person</strong>, with a property of <strong>name</strong> and a value of <strong>"Ali"</strong>. Now that we have a proper object, this is starting to feel a little more akin to Ruby and we can make use of our familiar dot notation again by calling <strong>.name</strong> on the <strong>person</strong> object.
                    </p>

                    <h4>JavaScript's Lexical Scoping</h4>
                    <p>
                      JavaScript is extremely liberal in terms of scoping. In the following example, all variables are visible and available for use by the entire program, simply because the second and third functions are nested within the first.
                    </p>


                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/f05c779666fdc8dc27d1e19f4df91ba8.js"></script>

                    <p>
                     Pretty scary stuff. It's particularly important to pay attention to encapsulation in JavaScript, otherwise you'll have global variables wreaking
                     havoc all over the place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ruby on the other hand, has much more stringent rules for scoping. Here is how we would perform a similar concatenation exercise accessing varialbes across methods in Ruby via instance variables: </p>

                      <script src="https://gist.github.com/arlyons/63327d5e5abc638585a82d68c832ac29.js"></script>

                      <p>Here we had to create <strong>instance variables</strong> in our <strong>initialize method</strong> in order for <strong>join method</strong> to be able to access them. In this way, Ruby has a clear call to encapsulation, and a built-in safeguard against accidental global scoping. </p>
