    Online security seems to be increasingly important these days with new and nefarious threats cropping up what seems like every few months, each more scary than the previous. Although this is a depressing state of affairs, there are a two simple steps that every
    individual can take to greatly decrease their chances of being hacked or falling victim to identity theft. Sadly, almost no one does them either out of ignorance or because the very steps needed to be taken seem counter intuitively to put one more at risk.

    One of the most important things you can do to guard against viruses is to update your browser and devices when prompted. Most of these updates contain patches that directly address newly discovered 
    security liabilities. Unfortunately, many people are somehow under the impression that these updates are either not important or worth the time or worse, consider them to be potential threats themselves. Many security breaches could be avoided by taking the time to update. (Google Chrome updates automatically and without the need for end-user approval.)

    Another self-defeating misconception is that it's safest to use your own memorized, passwords over stronger, unique passwords generated by a password manager program. The reasoning being something along the lines of "No one can hack my brain." While it's hard to argue with this logic, any password that can be memorized is generally rely on dictionary words and are not strong enough. Even though it seems a little scary to have your passwords stored in something that could potentially be hacked, password managers' ability to generate strong, unique passwords far outweighs this risk.
